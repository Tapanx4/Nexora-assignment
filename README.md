Vibe Matcher Prototype

This project is a prototype semantic search engine for "vibe-based" queries on a fashion product catalog.

Project Goal

Build a mini recommendation system that takes a natural language "vibe" query (e.g., "energetic urban chic"), embeds it, and matches it against a pre-embedded catalog of products to find the top-3 matches via cosine similarity.

Deliverable

This notebook (Vibe_Matcher_Prototype.ipynb) contains the full process, from data prep to evaluation and reflection.
