Vibe Matcher Prototype

This project is a prototype semantic search engine for "vibe-based" queries on a fashion product catalog.

Project Goal

Build a mini recommendation system that takes a natural language "vibe" query (e.g., "energetic urban chic"), embeds it, and matches it against a pre-embedded catalog of products to find the top-3 matches via cosine similarity.

Deliverable

This notebook (Vibe_Matcher_Prototype.ipynb) contains the full process, from data prep to evaluation and reflection.

Introduction & "Why AI at Nexora?"

This prototype demonstrates the power of semantic search in bridging the gap between ambiguous user intent and a concrete product catalog. By moving beyond keyword matching to "vibe" matching, we can create a more intuitive and human-centric discovery experience. For a company like Nexora, this AI-driven approach is not just a feature; it's a strategic tool to increase user engagement, reduce search abandonment, and create a powerful "style-finder" that understands users on their own terms. This system scales this understanding, turning subtle "vibes" into quantifiable vector matches, which can directly lead to higher conversion rates and a more personalized e-commerce journey.
